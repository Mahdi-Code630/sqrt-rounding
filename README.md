# Square Root Rounding

This project is a simple Python script that calculates the square root of input numbers and rounds the result to **4 decimal places**.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
Run the script in the terminal with:

```bash
python main.py
âœ¨ Example Input and Output
Input:
3
2
9
10
Output:
[1.4142, 3.0, 3.1623]


Note: You can also use string formatting (f"{value:.4f}") instead of round to always display exactly 4 decimal places.
